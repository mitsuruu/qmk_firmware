## DIP Switch Configuration

Alike with the stock HHKB keyboard, the first two DIP Switches (SW1 and SW2) can be used to configure the "mode" of the board. The DIP switches can be configured in the combinations below. [1]
| SW1   | SW2   | MODE     |
| :---  | :---  |  :----:  |
| OFF   | OFF   | HHKB     |
| ON    | OFF   | WINDOWS  |
| OFF   | ON    | MAC      |
| ON    | ON    | HHKB     |

In the case of having SW1 and SW2 both ON will result in HHKB mode, as "sun mode" is not supported on the HHKB Pro Classic. [2]
Additionally, some of the DIP switches are supported in the userspace, however not all of them are supported in their original configurations.
| DIP Switch | Function                          | Supported? |
| :----:     | :---                              |  :----:    |
| SW1        | Layout switch 1                   | YES        |
| SW2        | Layout switch 2                   | YES        |
| SW3        | Delete key becomes Backspace (on) | YES        |
| SW4        | Left ◇ key becomes Fn (on)       | NO         |
| SW5        | Swap ◇ and Alt (◇->Alt, Alt->◇) | YES        |
| SW6        | Power Savings Mode                | NO*        |

*SW6 acts as a bootloader toggle switch when using the dapboot bootloader. While it's functionality can be included, it should be ignored to prevent conflicts.

### Overriding DIP switch defaults

In order to override the DIP switches functionality, modify the `dip_switch_update_mask_user(uint32_t state)` and `process_record_hhkb(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record)` functions in `hhkb.c`.
As an example, overriding SW4 to make the Escape key send the string `HHKB is my favourite!`, you could add the following into `process_record_hhkb(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record)`
```c
case KC_ESCAPE:
    // SW4 - Replace ESC with text
    if (hhkb_dip_switch_config.sw4) {
        if (record->event.pressed) {
            send_string("HHKB is my favourite!");
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
```
